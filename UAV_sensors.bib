@article{Sanchez-Sanchez2016,
abstract = {Optimal trajectories for spacecraft guidance, be it during or-bital transfers or landing sequences are often pre-computed on ground and used as nominal desired solutions later tracked by a secondary control system. Linearization of the dynamics around such nominal profiles allows to cancel the error during the actual navigation phase when the trajectory is executed. In this study, instead, we assess the possibility of hav-ing the optimal guidance profile be represented on-board by a deep artificial neural network trained, using supervised learn-ing, to represent the optimal control structure. We show how the deep network is able to learn the structure of the optimal state-feedback outside of the training data and with great pre-cision. We apply our method to different interesting optimal control problems, a multicopter time and power optimal pin-point landing control problem and two different mass optimal spacecraft landing problems. In all cases, the deep network is able to safely learn the optimal state-feedback, also outside of the training data, making it a viable candidate for the imple-mentation of a reactive real-time optimal control architecture.},

@article{Braun2006,
abstract = {Significant technology advances have enabled planetary aircraft to be considered as viable science platforms. Such systems fill a unique planetary science measurement gap, that of regional-scale, near-surface observation, while providing a fresh perspective for potential discovery. Recent efforts have produced mature mission and flight system concepts, ready for flight project implementation. The development of a Mars airplane mission architecture that balances science, implementation risk, and cost is summarized. Airplane mission performance, flight system design, and technology maturation are described. The design, analysis, and testing completed demonstrates the readiness of this science platform for use in a Mars flight project.},
